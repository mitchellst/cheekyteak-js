# Cheeky Teak JS Apps
This is the development repo for single-page apps for the [cheeky teak project.](https://github.com/mitchellst/cheeky-teak)

It is mostly a portfolio piece for Mitchell Stoutin.

## Getting Up and Running
This project uses both npm and bower for dependency management. (Seems annoying, I know, but it makes sense, I promise.)
To get started, clone the repository and run both `npm init` and `bower init`. After that, pretty much everything is done
through the Gruntfile.
